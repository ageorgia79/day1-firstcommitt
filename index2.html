	<p>My name is Andy Georgia and I am pleased to meet all of you.  Feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andy.georgia.1">facebook</a> page here.  I was born in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and I now live in Greenville SC with my wife and three kids. We have been in Greenville for just a little over a year and we absolutely love the cultural diversity of the area.  We have lived in both North and South Carolina, Chicago, Floriday, Washington State and I'm sure somewhere else (I lost track)!  As a matter of fact, none of our kids were born in the same city or in the same hospital.  In addition to our three children, we recently learned that we are welcoming a fourth child into our family.  It would seem obvious that we have a passion for family.  All three of them are homeschooled by my wife and are very active in the youth church programs. A little info about the Georgia kids:

		<ol ALIGN="center">Maddox, Boy (age 7)</ol>

	<p>Maddox is the oldest of the three children.  He was born in July of 2006.  Aside from his age, I believe he is the smartest of the kids.  He reads constantly, and I mean "big-kid" books like The Hobbit and others.  He's not one of those picture book kids.  He knows his multiplication tables, can read and write and is already third grade level work at the age of a first grader.  His favorite thing to do is play video games and build legos.
		<ol ALIGN="center">Peyton, Girl (age 5)</ol>

	<p>Peyton is the oldest of the two girls.  She was born in January of 2009 when we were up in Chicago.  It was freezing cold but it was all worth it.  We didn't have a great experience with Chicago, but Peyton made it liveable for us.  She is now our little "princess".  She loves just about any Disney princess there is, loves to dance and she sings all day long.  For a five year old, she has an incredible voice.  Her favorite things are her dolls and building legos with her big brother.
		<ol ALIGN="center">Ryanne, Girl (age 2)</ol>

	<p>Ryanne is the youngest of the girls, and I must say, she is the drama queen and the one that worries me the most.  She was born in November 2011 and was a handful from the very first day.  She's just as cute as can be, but by far the most dramatic.  She is our youngest home school child, doing preschool work now.  Yes, that's right, preschool at 2 years old.  It really helps.  She knows her ABCs and 123s already.  So what's her favorite thing to do??  Well, lets just say what ever her older siblings are doing, and trying to annoy them while they do it.

	<p>I recently quit my job as a finance manager at a local car dealership to join this awesome program at The Iron Yard.  I am very excited about what this is going to do for me and the opportunities that it will open up.I don't really have a lot of experience with computers, but I'm looking forward to the challenge of this course.
	</p>

	<p>When I complete this course at the Iron Yard, I plan on looking to join a start-up.  I'm open to the possibility of working for an established company, but I have always liked to road less traveled.  I believe that, if the idea makes sense and the right people are in place, great things can happen.  All big companies started as small start-ups.</p>
